# Dataset Management and Basic Analysis System

This project is a Python-based system designed to read, manage and analyze numerical and categorical datasets. It describes the practical application of core Python programming concepts such as file handling, error handling, functions, loops, conditional statements, sets and object-oriented programming (OOP). The program reads numerical data from an external file, performs basic statistical analysis, extracts unique categorical values, evaluates performance based on the computed average and saves the analysis results into a report file.

The objective of this project is to show how Python can be used to process datasets in a structured and reliable manner. The system reads numerical data, calculates the total, average, minimum and maximum values using loops and arithmetic operators; and applies conditional logic to determine whether the overall performance is high or needs improvement. Additionalyy, the program reads categorical data from a file and uses a set to extract all unique categories and count them.

The project follows an object-oriented approach by defining a DataSet class that contains methods for loading data, calculating statistics, displaying results, and saving the final report. File handling techniques are used to read input data and write output results, while proper error handling ensures that the program responds gracefully to missing files, empty files, or invalid (non-numeric) data.

The project folder is organized as follows: the main Python file (dataset_analysis.py) contains the program logic, the data folder holds the input files (numeric_data.txt and categories.txt), and the report.txt file is automatically generated after the program runs. This structure keeps the project clean, organized and easy to maintain.

To run the program, ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system, open the project folder in VS Code, and execute the command `python dataset_analysis.py`. Once executed, the program loads the data, performs the analysis, displays the results on the console and saves the output into report.txt.

A sample output generated by the program includes the total, average, minimum, and maximum values of the dataset, the number of unique categories, and a performance status message indicating either “High Performance” or “Needs Improvement” based on the average score.
